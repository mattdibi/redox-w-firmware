/**
 * Provide a non-zero value here in applications that need to use several
 * peripherals with the same ID that are sharing certain resources
 * (for example, SPI0 and TWI0). Obviously, such peripherals cannot be used
 * simultaneously. Therefore, this definition allows to initialize the driver
 * for another peripheral from a given group only after the previously used one
 * is uninitialized. Normally, this is not possible, because interrupt handlers
 * are implemented in individual drivers.
 * This functionality requires a more complicated interrupt handling and driver
 * initialization, hence it is not always desirable to use it.
